# Flower_recognition


## Descrition
The dataset used for project is Flowers Recognition. The goal of the project is to classify five types of flowers (chamomile, tulip, rose, sunflower, dandelion). 
Dataset
The dataset contains 4323 images of flowers. The images are divided into five classes: chamomile, tulip, rose, sunflower, dandelion. For each class, there are about 800-1000 photos

## Preprocessing
1.	Resize all the input images to 224x224.
2.	Split dataset into: 
train = 0.70
validation = 0.20
test = 0.10

## Model
ImageNet is used to train deep neural networks using an architecture called convolutional layers.In this project it will be used to train a network that should classify flowers images into flower categories. Below are some of the steps from the project.


## Result
Model	Accuracy for validation samples
Train loss 0.608
Validation loss	0.533
Validation accuracy	0.844
